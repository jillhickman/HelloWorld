GDI Meetup demo

This was the demo for the Girl Develop It Meetup. This is a twist on the Hello World app. The main activity contains a button that takes you to the goodbye activity. 
The goodbye activity contains a "Goodbye" message as well as a goodbye image. It's more fun to create something that 
is more interactive!
